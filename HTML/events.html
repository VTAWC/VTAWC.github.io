            <h2>Women in Computing Day</h2>
            <p>The Association for Women in Computing hosts an outreach event every Spring semester in order to introduce girls (6th and 7th grade) to the world of computing. The event is called <b>Women in Computing Day</b>. This year is our 21st annual Women in Computing Day! This event is extremely important for girls at this age, and more importantly for the field of computing. The male to female ratio within the field still remains extremely low due to the fact that girls are not exposed to the field as often growing up. This is one of the main reasons we believe so much in this event and the main purpose of our club. During the event, the girls participate in four different activities in order expose them to the different possibilities in the field. The activities in past have introduced girls to Coding using Snap, Circuits using LEDs and batteries, App Design and Biotechnology.</p>
