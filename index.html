            <h1>The Association for Women in Computing is a student-run, non-profit organization at Virginia Tech.</h1>
            <p>
                For over <b>20 years</b>, we have worked to promote the recruitment and retention of women in
                technology-
                and
                computer-oriented professions. This mission is more critical now than ever, as the number of women
                pursuing
                Computer Science degrees has fallen below <b>10% nationally</b>, and below <b>5% at Virginia Tech</b>.
                Toward restoring
                diversity, we work with the close support of the Department of Computer Science, affiliated CSRC and
                other
                IT companies, and the College of Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>Our organization is comprised of undergraduate, graduate, and faculty members from various disciplines.
                Most
                of AWC‚Äôs members are Computer Science majors, but we also have Computer Science minors, Computer
                Engineering
                and BIT majors, and a variety of members from other disciplines. Anyone and everyone is welcome at AWC ‚Äî
                you
                don‚Äôt have to be a woman in computing to join, you just have to like them!
            </p>
            <p>AWC is involved in many different activities that are designed to foster professional development and
                contribute to the local community. We also have many social activities to help build an enduring sense
                of
                community. You can find out more about what we do on our <a href="events.html">Events</a> page, and if
                you‚Äôd

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p><b>GBMs, Workshops, & "Open Hours"</b></p>
            <p><b>Each month</b> AWC hosts general body meetings, workshops, and what we like to call "open hours".</p>
            <p>
                General body meetings are when members have the opportunity to network and stay up to date about
                upcoming
                AWC
                events. Workshops allow for members to grow professionally and build technical skills. "Open hours" are
                sessions held for mentor-mentee interaction, socialization, and academic support.
