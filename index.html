        <h1>Welcome to the Association for Women in Computing at Virginia Tech</h1>
        <p>The Association for Women in Computing is a student-run, non-profit organization at Virginia Tech. For over
            20 years, we have worked to promote the recruitment and retention of women in technology - and computer -
            oriented professions. This organization is not exclusive! Anyone and everyone who is passionate about
            computing and gender equality in the field of computing is welcome! Most members are in Computer Science
            (CS), Computer Engineering (CPE), Electrical Engineering (EE), Business Information Technology (BIT),
            Mathematics (MATH), Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA), and Statistics, but anyone passionate
            about our mission can join AWC in our networking, social, educational, outreach, and technical events!
